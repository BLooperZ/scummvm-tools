                              Antipasto
                              =========

Antipasto is the SoC game script decompiler prototype family.

Antipasto "Dirty D" (current) is the first prototype. It supports
a "large subset" of version 5 of SCUMM (all opcodes are implemented,
game specific hacks might be missing) and its goal is the
implementation of suitable control flow graph generation and
analyzation algorithms.

Requirements:

  - CHICKEN Scheme 2.6 (stable)
    http://call-with-current-continuation.org
  - gcc (for scheme->c compilation)

Build procedure:

These CHICKEN libraries ("eggs") are needed to compile Antipasto:

  - syntax-case
  - numbers
  - vector-lib
  - dyn-vector
  - digraph
  - graph-dfs
  - fmt

To obtain these execute

  $ chicken-setup syntax-case
  $ chicken-setup numbers
  ...

in your favorite shell. Afterwards a simple

  $ make                # builds other decompilers as well

or

  $ make antipasto      # ...

should compile her. To decompile a script it currently suffices to
specify the path to the script on the command line, since the current
prototype ("Dirty D") only supports SCUMM v5 at this point.

  $ antipasto path/to/script
