                    High Level Control Structures
                    =============================

Control structures have been classified according to their
complexity and based on an initial classification by Kosaraju it was
determined which classes were reducible to which other classes. An
expansion on this work by Ledgard and Marcotty was used to create a
hierarchical ordering of classes based on their semantical
reducibility.


                           Basic structures
                           ----------------

1. Action:                      single basic block

2. Composition:                 sequence of two structures

3. Conditional:                 if p then s1 else s2;
                                s1, s2 structures, p predicate

4. Pre-tested loop:             while p do s, s structure, p predicate

5. Single branch conditional:   if p then s, s structure, p predicate

6. N-way conditional:           case p of
                                 1 : s1
                                 2 : s2
                                 ...
                                 n : sn
                                end case

                                s1, ..., sn structures, p predicate

7. Post-tested loop:            repeat s until _, s structure

8. Multiexit loop:              while p1 do
                                      s1
                                      if p2 then exit
                                      s2
                                      if p3 then exit
                                      ...
                                      if pn then exit
                                      sn
                                end while

                                s1, ..., sn structures
                                p1, ..., pn predicates

9. Endless loop:                loop s end, s structure

10. Multilevel exit:            exit(i)
                                terminates i enclosing endless loops

11: Multilevel cycle:           cycle(i)
                                re-executes i-th enclosing endless
                                loop

12: Goto:                       unconditional control transfer


                               Classes
                               -------

D (Dijkstra)                                    D = {1,2,3,4}

D' (extension of D structures)                  D' = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}

BJn (BÃ¶hm and Jacopini,
     n := maximal number of predicates in a
          multiexit loop)                       BJn = {1,2,3,8}

REn (Repeat-End,
     n := maximum number of exit levels)        REn = {1,2,3,9,10}

RECn (RE with cycle(i) structures,
      n := number of levels)                    RECn = {1,2,3,9,10,11}

DREn (RE and Do-While loops,
      n := maximum number of enclosing levels
           to exit)                             DREn = {1,2,3,4,9,10}

DRECn (DRE and cycle(i) structures,
       n := maximum number of enclosing endless
            loops)                              DRECn = {1,2,3,4,9,
                                                         10,11}

GPn (any structure with one-in, one-out
     substructures with at most n different
     predicates)                                GPn = {1..7,9}

L (any well-formed structure, no restructions
   on number of predicates, actions, transfer
   of control -> goto statements allowed)       L = {1..12}


Definition:

 Let s1 and s2 be two structures,
 s1 is a semantical conversion of s2 iff

  - for every input, s2 computes the same function as s1
  - the primitive actions and predicates of s2 are
    precsicely those of s1


               Hierarchy based on semantical conversion
               ----------------------------------------

(classes higher up in the hierarchy are a semantic conversion of the
 lower classes) 

        REinf = RECinf = DREinf = DRECinf = GPinf = L
              |                 |
              |           .DREn = DRECn
              |     .....       .
          REn = RECn            .
              .                 .
              .           .DRE1 = DREC1
              .     .....
          RE1 = REC1
              |
            BJinf
              .
             BJ2
              |
       D = D' = BJ1 = GP1


                  Generic Set of Control Structures
                  ---------------------------------

Antipasto structures control flow graphs using the set of generic
control structures D' + goto = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,12}.
REn, RECn, DREn and DRECn can be simulated via the use of goto.
